# STARK

We present the _Software Tool for the Analysis of Robustness in the unKnown environment_ (**STARK**), our Java tool for the specification, analysis and verification of robustness properties of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) operating in the presence of uncertainty and perturbations.
STARK is based on the _evolution sequence model_ for the representation of the behaviour of systems, and on the _Robustness Temporal logic_ (_RobTL_)  for the specification of robustness properties of systems.

Briefly, STARK includes:
* a domain specific specification language for systems, perturbations, distances, and RobTL formulae;
* a module for the simulation of the behaviour of systems and their perturbed versions;
* a module for the evaluation of distances between behaviours;
* a statistical model checker for RobTL formulae;
* a module for the interaction with the user (front-end).

In this wiki we will explore these five modules in detail, giving to the users all the information they need to use STARK for their analysis.
